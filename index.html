            <h2>Historic Williamsburg, Virginia</h2>

            <p>Williamsburg is a city in the U.S. state of Virginia. As of the
            2010 U.S. Census, the population was 14,068. In 2019, the population
            was estimated to be 14,954. Located on the Virginia Peninsula,
            Williamsburg is in the northern part of the Hampton Roads
            metropolitan area. It is bordered by James City County and York
            County.</p>
            <p>Williamsburg was founded in 1632 as Middle Plantation, a
            fortified settlement on high ground between the James and York
            Rivers. The city served as the capital of the Colony and
            Commonwealth of Virginia from 1699 to 1780 and was the center of
            political events in Virginia leading to the American Revolution. The
            College of William & Mary, established in 1693, is the second-oldest
            institution of higher education in the United States and the only
            one of the nine colonial colleges located in the South; its alumni
            include three U.S. presidents as well as many other important
            figures in the nation's early history.</p>
            <p>The city's tourism-based economy is driven by Colonial
            Williamsburg, the restored Historic Area of the city. Along with
            nearby Jamestown and Yorktown, Williamsburg forms part of the
            Historic Triangle, which attracts more than four million tourists
            each year. Modern Williamsburg is also a college town, inhabited
            in large part by William & Mary students, faculty and staff.</p>
